\question Hand this one in. Forty students were about to graduate high
school and go to college. They had all taken college entrance verbal
and math tests, and the score on each of these out of 100 was
recorded. At the end of each student's first year in college, their
college GPA was recorded (on the same 4-point scale that U of T
uses). To save space, the data values were saved as follows: some
verbal scores, some mathematics scores (for the same students) and
some college GPAs. Then some more verbal scores, some more mathematics
scores, and so on. The data as recorded were in nine columns, with the
verbal scores being in columns 1, 4, and 7, the mathematics scores in
columns 2, 5 and 8, and the college GPAs in columns 3, 6 and 9.
